Identification of a Novel MET Exon 14 Skipping Variant Coexistent with EGFR Mutation in Lung Adenocarcinoma Sensitive to Combined Treatment with Afatinib and Crizotinib
To the Editor:
A 60-year-old man presented to Hunan Cancer Hospital with symptoms of cough and shortness of breath for 1month in August 1, 2018. He has a smoking history of 300 pack-years for almost 30 years. A chest computed tomography scan showed a right upper lobe nodule measuring approximately 3.0 by 2.3 cm, multiple lymph node metastases in the mediastinum, right pleural effusion, and right middle lobe inflammation. Isotope bone scan showed multiple bone metastases, but brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Histologic examination of a pleural effusion cytologic specimen was performed, resulting in a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. A large gene detection panel containing at least108 oncogenic genes and next-generation sequencing (NGS, Burning Rock, Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China [see Supplementary Digital Content 1) were used for cytologic examination of the metastatic pleural effusion. The genotype was EGFR exon 18 (c.2156G＞C,p.Gly750Ala, abundance 5.08%) and MNNG HOS Transforming gene (MET) exon14 (c.2888-21_2888-20delinsGC, abundance 8.61%) mutation (Fig. 1A–D).Treatment with afatinib, 30 mg orally daily, plus crizotinib, 250 mg orally twice daily, was initiated on August 14, 2018. Evaluation computed tomography of the head, neck, and chest was performed in September28, 2018 (6 weeks after the combined treatments), and a partial response was obtained for the patient (Fig. 1E and F). As of now, the patient has been receiving treatment with afatinib plus crizotinib for more than 3months and the response has been maintained. The treatment has been tolerable, and the main side effects have been grade 2 mouth ulcers, diarrhea, and an increased alanine transaminase level. 
EGFR exon18 G719A mutation and MET exon14mutation are a defined distinct molecular subset of NSCLC. These two rare mutations present in 3% to 5%and 3% of patients with NSCLC, respectively.1,2 In the LUX-Lung series of studies, afatinib demonstrated superiority to chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC with uncommon mutation, with 77% of patients achieving a response and a median progression-free survival of13.8 months in cases with EGFR exon 18 mutations.3,4In addition, crizotinib has proved to be highly effective in patients with advanced NSCLC with MET exon14 skipping mutation.5

To our knowledge, MET exon14 c.2888-21_2888-20delinsGC is a mutation that has never been reported before, and its effect on the efficacy of crizotinib in firstline treatment is also unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient carrying MET exon14c.2888-21_2888-20delinsGC coexistent with EGFRexon18G719A mutation. Because we did not know which of them was the dominant driver gene of the tumor and because there is no previous research reported, both afatinib and crizotinib were given. Dose adjustment of afatinib from 40 mg/d to 30 mg/d has no adverse affecting efficacy according to the Lux-Lung series of studies. Considering that the combination therapy may increase adverse events, we chose a regimen of afatinib,30 mg orally once daily, and crizotinib, 250 mg orally twice daily. This regimen has proved to be both effective and tolerable.
